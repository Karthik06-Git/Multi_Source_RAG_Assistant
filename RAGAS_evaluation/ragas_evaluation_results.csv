0,What is a pandas Series and what kind of data can it hold?,"['Series is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type (integers, strings, floating point numbers, Python objects, etc.).']","A pandas Series is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type such as integers, floats, strings, or Python objects.",A pandas Series is a one-dimensional labeled array that can hold various data types.,1.0,0.8293168377100134,0.9999999999,1.0
1,What is a pandas DataFrame and how is it structured?,"['A DataFrame is a two-dimensional, size-mutable, potentially heterogeneous tabular data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns).']","A pandas DataFrame is a two-dimensional labeled data structure with rows and columns. It is size-mutable and can contain heterogeneous data types, similar to a table.",A pandas DataFrame is a two-dimensional labeled table that can store heterogeneous data.,1.0,0.9281518342241346,0.9999999999,1.0
2,What is a NumPy ndarray and why is it used?,"['NumPy provides the ndarray, a homogeneous array object that contains elements of the same type.', 'The ndarray is efficient for numerical operations.']","A NumPy ndarray is a homogeneous, multi-dimensional array of fixed-size items. It is used for efficient numerical computation and supports fast mathematical operations.",A NumPy ndarray is a homogeneous array designed for fast numerical computation.,1.0,0.9652973855062339,0.99999999995,1.0
3,How is a NumPy array different from a Python list?,"['NumPy arrays are faster and more memory-efficient than Python lists.', 'Python lists can hold elements of different data types, while NumPy arrays typically contain elements of a single type.']","Unlike Python lists, NumPy arrays store elements of the same data type and are optimized for numerical operations, making them faster and more memory-efficient.",NumPy arrays differ from Python lists by being homogeneous and optimized for numerical operations.,0.8,0.9492990644481153,0.99999999995,1.0
4,What are the main data structures provided by pandas?,"['pandas provides two primary data structures: Series and DataFrame.', 'Series is one-dimensional, while DataFrame is two-dimensional.']","The primary data structures provided by pandas are Series and DataFrame. Series represents one-dimensional data, while DataFrame represents two-dimensional tabular data.",pandas mainly provides Series and DataFrame as its core data structures.,1.0,0.9727204100284492,0.99999999995,1.0
